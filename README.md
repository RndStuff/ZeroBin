Forked ZeroBin 0.20 Alpha with file support

ZeroBin is a minimalist, opensource online pastebin where the server
has zero knowledge of pasted data. Data is encrypted/decrypted in the
browser using 256 bits AES.

This is the forked version of ZeroBin 0.19 Alpha (https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin) which contains added functionality and support for files, and also uses the simplified bootstrap theme

Code was also pulled from other forks, please look at the fork list on github for merges and changes
